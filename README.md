# Learn_Solana_1
First program to teach myself Solana full stack programming. Done by following a tutorial and adding additinal features to it. Program creates a stack and additional data stored on the Solana blockchain (in this case, set up for localhost). The UI is built with React and connects to Phantom Wallet.
